Wipro banking on Holmes to become more profitable</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bengaluru, Sept. 20 -- <span class="companylink">Wipro Ltd</span>
 expects its artificial intelligence platform Holmes to offset the 
pricing decline in commoditized outsourcing contracts, a development 
that could help India's third-largest software services firm arrest 
falling profitability in the current financial year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are currently 
deploying Holmes very aggressively," K.R. Sanjiv, the chief technology 
officer at Wipro, said in an interview. "Overall profitability is a 
function of many things, the pricing, how we structure the contracts. 
But certainly hyper automation should result in a beneficial impact and 
you can see the first meaningful impact by the end of March 2017."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comments should bring some relief to <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>
 investors. The company's operating margin had fallen to 17.8% at the 
end of the June quarter from 19.7% at the end of March quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sanjiv declined to give details, including the number of projects in which <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>
 is using Holmes or the exact quantum of profitability improvement tied 
to it. The company usually does not give any annual outlook on revenue 
or profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wipro</span>'s thrust on automating tasks, 
thereby replacing work of engineers with intelligent platforms, is one 
of the six strategies laid out by company's chief executive officer, 
Abidali Neemuchwala, to put the firm back on the growth pedestal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last few years, <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>'s growth has lagged behind its larger rivals, and the company reported a 3.7% dollar revenue growth in 2015-16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>'s
 internal plans, the management expects to save up to $46.5 million and 
free up around 3,000 engineers from mundane software maintenance 
activities, and also generate $60-$70 million in revenue by selling 
platform-based solutions to new and existing clients in the current 
financial year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sanjiv, who declined to disclose the savings projected by <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>,
 said it is working on a two-pronged strategy, under which it will 
automate tasks in managed service projects and also sell Holmes-based 
solutions to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holmes, or "heuristics 
and ontology-based learning machines and experiential systems", is an 
intelligent platform, which promises to bring efficiency for clients by 
reducing errors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, it helps <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> save on wage costs by deploying fewer people to complete a task.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are implementing 
Holmes to bring productivity, which straight away goes to our 
bottomline. By automating, we are increasing productivity of our people.
 We are taking Holmes-based solution into the market," said Sanjiv.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>, larger rival <span class="companylink">Infosys Ltd</span>, too, expects to see the automation-related productivity boost to reflect in a meaningful way only from April 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homegrown technology 
firms are aggressively embracing automation platforms to retain 
profitability as most of the large outsourcing contracts are seeing 
pricing pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both <span class="companylink">Infosys</span> and <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>
 have made their proprietary technology-backed automation and AI-powered
 platforms like Mana and Holmes, respectively, as the cornerstone of 
their long-term goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Infosys</span> aims to improve its operating 
margins from the current level of 24.1% to 30% and increase its revenue 
from $9.5 billion to $20 billion by March 2021. <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> aspires to improves its margin to 23% and increase its revenue from $7.35 billion to $15 billion by March 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The embrace of automation tools by Indian IT firms could have wider consequences, according to experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The emergence of 
intelligent automation underlines the disruption that is about to hit 
the supply side," said Thomas Reuner, managing director of IT 
outsourcing research at <span class="companylink">HfS Research</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the big gains of 
large-scale adoption of automation tools is incremental growth in 
business for home-grown technology firms, who can deploy engineers to 
work in newer projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This particularly helps 
in the latter half of the calendar year when decision-making on 
traditional outsourcing contracts gets pushed back due to the year-end 
holidays.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fatehpuri Sikri is known 
for its transitory spaces, pavilions, porches and verandahs, and 
Varanasi cannot be divorced from its ghats, nor Old Delhi from its 
streets. Architect Vidur Bharadwaj capitalises on these ancient elements
 of social interactions in his canvases. In his first-ever exhibition 
titled "Soul in Structure" at Delhi's Visual Arts Gallery, he attempts 
to show how design elements of heritage monuments can meld into modern 
buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exhibition has nearly
 15 canvases that showcase ideas in commercial and residential spaces. 
Bharadwaj, who is the Director of The 3C Company, wears his ratings of 
gold and platinum awards from LEED as medals in this show, telling 
visitors how inspired his buildings such as the <span class="companylink">Wipro Technologies</span>, Gurgaon; Patni Knowledge Centre, Noida; and Knowledge Boulevard, Noida, have been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've been working on 
sustainable architecture for over 15 years. I wondered how to take the 
idea of sustainable design to the people. If you just put up a building 
and show, people don't get it. So I opted for a populist way, and 
through my paintings show how the past, the present and the future came 
together," says Bharadwaj, 50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Courtyards and water 
bodies are ubiquitous in every painting, with the imagery of the sun and
 a child visible in every work. "The sun is the source of all energy, 
and the child represents the future," says the Delhi-based architect, 
adding, "I have combined photographs of my projects with elements that 
inspire me as an architect, be it in nature or monuments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While his paintings are 
given the names of his award-winning buildings, the disconnect is 
evident between concept and reality. If International Home Deco Park 
(IHDP) takes inspiration from the ghats of Varanasi, one wonders how a 
water body with stepped landscaping in a glass-covered commercial 
complex qualifies as a sustainable idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between evoking the 
ghosts of Fatehpur Sikri, Mohenjo Daro and Udaipur, the architect seems 
to be telling too many stories in one frame - how classic architectural 
elements honoured climatic conditions, and awarded its users fresh air, 
shade, light and wind, and on the other hand, how glass-clad, 
green-rated buildings are energy-efficient for present-day clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exhibition is on till September 22</p>

 has shown a commitment to questioning the status quo" said Reetika 
Joshi, Research Director, Operations &amp; Analytics Strategies for HfS.
 "They understand that it is not enough to offer back-office support.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2016 SEP 19 
(VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of 
Engineering -- A patent by the inventors Bhaumik, Soham (Bangalore, IN);
 Kumar, Hemant (Mayur Vihar Phase, IN); Krishna, Amit (Bangalore, IN); 
Ramkumar, Nithya (Bangalore, IN); Krishnaswamy, Sridhar (Bangalore, IN),
 filed on August 19, 2014, was published online on September 6, 2016, 
according to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by 
VerticalNews correspondents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patent number 9436544 is assigned to <span class="companylink">Wipro Limited</span> (Bangalore, IN).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following quote was 
obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by
 the inventors: "Typically, business process management systems are 
built on a monolithic architecture that has constraints at the 
application level. At the application level there may be cases where the
 provision for error recovery may be very limited or do not exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By way of example, in a 
scenario where a functionality instance has to send an e-mail to 
complete a business process, but the email sending mechanism fails due 
to a fault, such as a network error or system error, the activity flow 
of the business process is interrupted or stopped until the e-mail 
functionality is resolved. In this type of example, typically the error 
recovery process would be done manually with help of human interaction 
using another system or through updates. Unfortunately, this would add 
significant time delays on the completion of the business process."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the 
background information obtained for this patent, VerticalNews 
journalists also obtained the inventors' summary information for this 
patent: "A method for implementing error detection and recovery includes
 receiving, by the application management computing device, from one or 
more agents monitoring one or more subsystem processes of a business 
process operating in a cloud based architecture an identification of an 
error condition in at least one of the subsystem processes. 
Additionally, any associated information or data necessary to execute 
the at least one of the subsystem processes with the identified error 
condition is received by the application management computing device. An
 error recovery process for the at least one of the subsystem processes 
with the identified error condition is executed by the application 
management computing device. The recovered at least one of the subsystem
 processes with the identified error condition is reinitiated, by the 
application management computing device, using the received information 
or data corresponding to the at least one of the subsystem processes 
with the identified error condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"An application 
management computing device includes a processor coupled to a memory and
 configured to be capable of executing programmed instructions stored in
 the memory includes receiving from one or more agents monitoring one or
 more subsystem processes of a business process operating in a cloud 
based architecture an identification of an error condition in at least 
one of the subsystem processes. Additionally, any associated information
 or data necessary to execute the at least one of the subsystem 
processes with the identified error condition is received. An error 
recovery process for the at least one of the subsystem processes with 
the identified error condition is executed by the application management
 computing device. The recovered at least one of the subsystem processes
 with the identified error condition is reinitiated using the received 
information or data corresponding to the at least one of the subsystem 
processes with the identified error condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A non-transitory 
computer readable medium having stored thereon instructions for 
implementing error detection and recovery comprising machine executable 
code which when executed by a processor, causes the processor to perform
 steps including receiving from one or more agents monitoring one or 
more subsystem processes of a business process operating in a cloud 
based architecture an identification of an error condition in at least 
one of the subsystem processes. Additionally, any associated information
 or data necessary to execute the at least one of the subsystem 
processes with the identified error condition is received. An error 
recovery process for the at least one of the subsystem processes with 
the identified error condition is executed by the application management
 computing device. The recovered at least one of the subsystem processes
 with the identified error condition is reinitiated using the received 
information or data corresponding to the at least one of the subsystem 
processes with the identified error condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This technology provides
 a number of advantages including providing methods, devices, and 
non-transitory computer readable media that efficiently and effectively 
implement error detection and recovery automatically for a business 
process operating in a cloud based architecture. With this technology, 
the time period for recovering and reinitiating a subsystem process is 
substantially reduced. Additionally, with this technology other 
subsystems processes are able to continue execution during the error 
recovery. Further, this technology is able to obtain and provide metrics
 about instances of the subsystem modules or processes during the life 
cycle of a business process and can make automatic adjustments related 
to error recovery."</p>

 must also focus on achieving competitive advantage and meeting 
strategic growth objectives. By integrating process excellence, risk 
intelligence and advanced technologies, we tackle the mortgage industry 
pressures of today while preparing clients for rapid market, economic

Wipro steps up blockchain focus</span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bengaluru, Sept. 16 -- <span class="companylink">Wipro Ltd</span>
 has set up a research facility to develop software applications using 
blockchain, the technology behind virtual currency Bitcoin. India's 
third largest software firm has partnered with a few start-ups to scale 
up the business and is in the midst of completing a few so-called pilot 
projects. <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>'s push into building applications using the blockchain technology makes it the third outsourcing firm, after <span class="companylink">Tata Consultancy Services Ltd</span> (TCS), and <span class="companylink">Infosys Ltd</span>,
 to embrace the database technology. Disruptive technologies, such as 
blockchain, are upending the traditional outsourcing model of deploying 
an army of engineers in cheap locations. Leveraging blockchain 
technology will enable companies such as <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> and its local rivals, <span class="companylink">Infosys</span> and TCS, to help their clients cut costs and improve productivity. <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> is working on a few projects using blockchain technology for its banking clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> The technology can offer
 an alternative to the current global money-transfer network SWIFT, 
according to a senior company executive. "Blockchain is a big focus area
 because of the potential the technology offers... For us, the focus 
areas are SWIFT, asset management and identity management," Wipro's 
chief technology officer K.R. Sanjiv said in an interview on Monday. "We
 have built some prototypes, done demos, and we are in the process of 
implementing some internal use cases for our customers." Blockchain, in 
simple terms, is a universal ledger that maintains records and manages 
transactions through a reliable publicly accessible database. The 
technology eliminates the need of a central authority (like a bank) to 
authenticate a transaction. These transactions are secured by advanced 
cryptography. The consensus method of transaction approval also makes 
the system extremely difficult to hack. Many have dubbed the blockchain 
technology to be the biggest innovation since the birth of the Internet.
 Billionaire Marc Andreessen termed it as "the big breakthrough". 
Andreessen's venture-capital fund <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span>, is estimated to have invested more than $50 million in blockchain- focused start-ups. Companies such as TCS, <span class="companylink">Infosys</span> and <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>
 hope to help customers by offering solutions that can enable two 
entities in different countries to transfer money directly, eliminating 
the use of an intermediary bank. This can potentially save clients 
money, and will make the process simpler and faster. Though revenue from
 these technologies may not be big now, investment in these technologies
 is certainlythe right approach, experts say. "As soon as the client 
base of global banking platform vendors (mainly banks) consider Bitcoin 
and blockchain as mainstream, it will be the time when banking platform 
vendors should incorporate bitcoin/blockchain capabilities into their 
solutions," said Jost Hoppermann, vice-president, banking applications 
and architecture, at <span class="companylink">Forrester Research Inc</span>. "Vendors with more advanced architectures will certainly find it easier to offer this kind of support." <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>
 has set up the blockchain research facility at its Bengaluru campus to 
help its engineers build applications. "Now whether it (blockchain) 
plays out in one year, two years or five years is a different thing. 
That is crystal- gazing," said Sanjiv, who reports to Rishad Premji, 
chief strategy officer and son of Wipro chairman Azim Premji. For now, <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>
 generates a tiny portion of its revenue from offering blockchain 
solutions but this could change, once more companies adopt this 
technology. Sanjiv declined to name the partners with whom the company 
is working on blockchain technologies. "Our objective is to gain 
expertise in all technologies as all of them are emerging because none 
of them is a winner for now," said Sanjiv.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Sept. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- First Book, a nonprofit social enterprise, and <span class="companylink">Wipro Ltd</span>. (NYSE: WIT, BSE: 507685, NSE: <span class="companylink">WIPRO</span>),
 a leading global information technology, consulting and business 
process services company, launched a year-long partnership yesterday at 
the 2016 <span class="companylink">Congressional Black Caucus Foundation</span>'s Annual Legislative Conference that will provide 50,000 brand new books for children in need in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Book ownership and a 
print-rich environment are leading indicators of a child's educational 
success, but for the 32 million children growing up in low-income 
families in the U.S. alone, books are scarce. Studies have found that in
 low-income neighborhoods there is only one book for every 300 children;
 whereas in moderate income neighborhoods, there are 13 books for every 
one child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First Book, which has 
operations in both the U.S. and Canada, works with formal and informal 
educators serving children in need ages 0-18 in a wide range of settings
 -- from schools, classrooms, summer school and parks and rec programs, 
to health clinics, homeless shelters, faith-based programs, libraries, 
museums, summer food sites and more. The organization estimates there 
are more than 1.3 million classrooms and programs that are serving 
children in need in the U.S. alone, more than 5,000 of which sign up 
with First Book every month. First Book's community of 275,000 educators
 is the largest and fastest growing educational network exclusively 
serving children in need in North America. First Book now supports an 
estimated one in five educators working in the lives of children in need
 in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partnership between the organizations kicked off yesterday at the <span class="companylink">Congressional Black Caucus Foundation</span>'s professional development program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, First Book and <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>
 joined the Caucus member's spouses to serve a hot breakfast and provide
 clothing, toiletries, health screenings and other resources to 
approximately 350 people at Central Union Mission in Washington, D.C. 
First Book and <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> also donated a laptop to the Mission, and provided 700 brand new children's books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conference marked the start of a series of book distributions by First Book and <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> to schools and programs in <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> communities in the U.S. and Canada, including San Francisco, Tampa, Dallas, Atlanta, Toronto and other locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upcoming Events </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- September 27, San Francisco: Bryant Elementary in the Mission District 
      will host a reading event and celebration of a 3,000-book donation, 
      including bilingual books, to create 10 brand new individual classroom 
      libraries. An additional 3,000 books will go to John Yehall Chin 
      Elementary, creating another 10 brand new individual classroom libraries, 
      for a total of 20. 
 
   -- September 30 -- October 1, Tampa, Fla.: <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>, First Book and <span class="companylink">American 
      Federation of Teachers</span> will donate a truck full of 40,000 books, plus

      Book Marketplace credits for educators to access more resources through 
      First Book. 
 
   -- Atlanta: <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> employees will pack 500 brand new backpacks with three 
      brand new books each from First Book, a total of 1,500 books and 
      backpacks for area children in need. 
 
   -- Toronto: <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> and First Book will be donating 8,000 books to 
      under-resourced schools and programs. </pre>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Wipro</span>
 and its employees have gone above and beyond to help bring First Book's
 resources into the communities where they work and live," said Kyle 
Zimmer, president and CEO of First Book. "Thanks to the dedication and 
enthusiasm of <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>'s employees at reading events and at book distributions, along with <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>'s
 financial support, tens of thousands of children will experience the 
transformative power of books, to fuel learning and unlock their

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several stock 
market experts who keep saying that “valuation doesn't matter so long as
 you are buying fundamentally strong companies and are ready to hold it 
for long term“. Is it true? Not really. And the long term <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> chart is the best example of this. As visible from the chart, <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>
 stock reached unsustainable levels during the dotcom boom and the 
investors who bought it at 2000 peak is yet to recover their money, even
 after holding for more than 16 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wipro</span> has all qualities of a fundamentally strong company, but the villain here was the lofty valuations in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why seasoned 
value investors like AjitDayal, founder and chairman, Quantum MF insist 
on paying only “reasonable price“. “There are three basic ingredients to
 long-term investing -select fundamentally strong companies, paying only
 reasonable price and waiting patiently,“ he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mumbai ITAT rules on 
selection of comparables for assessee providing information technology 
and software support services to AE during AY 2008-09; Noting that TPO 
himself applied turnover filter of less than Rs 1 crore but did not fix 
any upper turnover limit, opines “When the Transfer Pricing Officer has 
applied turnover filter by rejecting companies having less than Rs 1 
crore turnover from software development services, logically, he should 
have fixed an upper limit for rejecting companies having very high 
turnover as well”; Relying on Bombay HC ruling in <span class="companylink">Pentair Water India</span>,
 holds “Companies which are having more than 20 times the turnover of 
the assessee from software development services segment…cannot be 
treated as comparables” and directs AO/TPO to exclude 3 companies (<span class="companylink">Infosys Technologies Ltd</span>., <span class="companylink">Tata Elxsi Ltd</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> and <span class="companylink">Wipro Ltd</span>)
 having turnover of more than Rs 20 crores from software development 
services segment; However, ITAT clarifies that decision to exclude 
companies having turnover of more than Rs 20 crore was purely in the 
context of peculiar facts in the present case and hence could not be 
considered as a precedent; Specifically with respect to <span class="companylink">Infosys Technologies Ltd</span>,
 rejects Revenue’s contention that since assessee had not objected to 
its selection at any stage it could not raise the issue before Tribunal,
 notes that assessee’s TP-study and updated margin submitted during 
TP-proceedings were rejected and TPOundertook a search process himself 
by applying certain filters which yielded certain comparables including <span class="companylink">Infosys Technologies</span> and opines that “Therefore, it cannot be said that <span class="companylink">Infosys Technologies Ltd</span>.
 is a comparable selected by the assessee.”; ITAT also excludes 7 
comparables (including 3 comparables rejected also on the basis of 
turnover) on grounds of functional dissimilarity, follows various 
precedents:ITAT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ruling was delivered by ITAT Bench of Shri Saktijit Dey and Shri Ramit Kochar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. M. P. Lohia along with Mr Pranay Gandhi argued on behalf of assessee whereas Revenue was represented by Mr N. K. Chand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The assessee, UCB India Pvt Ltd, is a wholly owned subsidiary of M/s. <span class="companylink">UCB</span>–SA,
 Belgium and is primarily engaged in the business of manufacturing and 
distribution of pharmaceutical products. The assessee also provides 
information technology and network support services to its Associate 
Enterprises (AEs).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During AY 2008-09, the 
assessee provided information technology and software support services 
to its AE including remote monitoring of information technology system, 
trouble shooting of information technology related problem, back up 
related task. To benchmark the transaction, assessee adopted TNMM as the
 MAM with Operating Profit to Operating Cost (OP/OC) as Profit Level 
Indicator (PLI). The assessee selected 23 companies as comparables using
 multiyear data with average margin of 14.41% to demonstrate that its 
margin of 13.97% was at ALP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TPO accepted TNMM as MAM 
with OP/OC as PLI, however, by applying some fresh set of filters, 
finalized 23 companies as comparables with arithmetic mean of 24.99% and
 proposed a TP adjustment of Rs 8.45 lakhs. DRP confirmed TPO’s order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aggrieved, the assessee preferred an appeal before Mumbai ITAT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turnover filter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the ITAT, assessee
 contended that companies having turnover of more than Rs 20 crore 
should be excluded as the assessee turnover was only Rs 87.39 lakhs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ITAT noted that the TPO 
had himself applied turnover filter of less than Rs 1 crore, however, 
did not fix any upper limit while applying the turnover filter. In this 
regard, ITAT opined that, “When the Transfer Pricing Officer has applied
 turnover filter by rejecting companies having less than Rs 1 crore 
turnover from software development services, logically, he should have 
fixed an upper limit for rejecting companies having very high turnover 
as well”. ITAT also noted that against the assessee turnover of Rs 87.39
 lakhs from software development services, some of the comparables 
selected by the assessee had turnover of more than Rs 20 crores viz. <span class="companylink">Infosys Technologies Ltd</span>., <span class="companylink">Tata Elxsi Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">Wipro Ltd</span> with Rs 15,653 crores, Rs 342 crores and Rs 11,276 crores respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ITAT observed that DRP, while upholding the turnover filter adopted by the TPO, referred to <span class="companylink">OECD</span>
 guidelines to observe that company with approximately five times 
revenue could be taken as comparable. Applying the same logic of the 
DRP, ITAT held that, “companies with extraordinarily high turnover 
cannot be treated as comparable”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relying on the High Court decision in <span class="companylink">Pentair Water India Pvt. Ltd</span>
 [TS-566-HC-2015(BOM)-TP], ITAT held that, “Companies which are having 
more than 20 times the turnover of the assessee from software 
development services segment…cannot be treated as comparables”. 
Accordingly, ITAT directed the TPO to exclude companies having turnover 
of more than Rs 20 crores from software development services segment 
from the list of comparables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Infosys Technologies Ltd</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specifically with regard to <span class="companylink">Infosys Technologies Ltd</span>,
 Revenue submitted that this company was chosen as a comparable by 
assessee in its TP-study as well as during course of proceedings before 
TPO. Revenue contended that assessee had at no stage objected the 
selection of <span class="companylink">Infosys Technologies Ltd</span> 
and hence without raising an additional ground in terms of rule 11 of IT
 (AT) Rule, 1963, the assessee could not raise the issue at this stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ITAT noted that assessee had selected <span class="companylink">Infosys Technologies Ltd</span>.
 as a comparable in the transfer pricing study and even in the course of
 proceedings before TPO. However, ITAT stated that “fact remains the 
transfer pricing study report as well as the updated margin submitted by
 the assessee in the course of proceedings before the Transfer Pricing 
Officer were rejected. It is further evident, after rejecting the 
transfer pricing study report, the Transfer Pricing Officer undertook a 
search process himself by applying certain filters which yielded certain
 comparables including <span class="companylink">Infosys Technologies Ltd</span>. Therefore, it cannot be said that <span class="companylink">Infosys Technologies Ltd</span>. is a comparable selected by the assessee.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, ITAT stated that from TPO’s order, it was clearly evident that <span class="companylink">Infosys Technologies Ltd</span>
 was proposed as comparable after search in database. Also, ITAT noted 
that assessee had objected to wrong application of turnover filter by 
the TPO not only before the Tribunal but before the DRP also. In view of
 the above, ITAT held that, “For the first time assessee has not raised 
the issue of rejection of certain comparables on the basis of turnover” 
and refused to accept the contention of the Revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accordingly, ITAT 
directed the TPO to determine ALP afresh after removing the companies 
having turnover of more than Rs 20 crore. ITAT further clarified that 
the decision to exclude companies having turnover of more than Rs 20 
crore was purely in the context of the peculiar facts of the present 
case and hence could not be considered as a precedent.</p>

Wipro steps up blockchain focus</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bengaluru, Sept. 14 -- <span class="companylink">Wipro Ltd</span>
 has set up a research facility to develop software applications using 
blockchain, the technology behind virtual currency Bitcoin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India's third largest 
software firm has partnered with a few start-ups to scale up the 
business and is in the midst of completing a few so-called pilot 
projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wipro</span>'s push into building applications using the blockchain technology makes it the third outsourcing firm, after <span class="companylink">Tata Consultancy Services Ltd</span> (TCS), and <span class="companylink">Infosys Ltd</span>, to embrace the database technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disruptive technologies, 
such as blockchain, are upending the traditional outsourcing model of 
deploying an army of engineers in cheap locations. Leveraging blockchain
 technology will enable companies such as <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> and its local rivals, <span class="companylink">Infosys</span> and TCS, to help their clients cut costs and improve productivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wipro</span> is working on a few projects 
using blockchain technology for its banking clients. The technology can 
offer an alternative to the current global money-transfer network SWIFT,
 according to a senior company executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Blockchain is a big 
focus area because of the potential the technology offers. For us, the 
focus areas are, SWIFT, asset management and identity management," 
Wipro's chief technology officer K.R. Sanjiv said in an interview on 
Monday. "We have built some prototypes, done demos, and we are in the 
process of implementing some internal use cases for our customers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blockchain, in simple 
terms, is a universal ledger that maintains records and manages 
transactions through a reliable publicly accessible database. The 
technology eliminates the need of a central authority (like a bank) to 
authenticate a transaction. These transactions are secured by advanced 
cryptography. The consensus method of transaction approval also makes 
the system extremely difficult to hack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many have dubbed the 
blockchain technology to be the biggest innovation since the birth of 
the Internet. Billionaire Marc Andreessen termed it as "the big 
breakthrough".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andreessen's venture-capital fund <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span>, is estimated to have invested more than $50 million in blockchain-focused start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies like TCS, <span class="companylink">Infosys</span> and <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>
 hope to help customers by offering solutions that can enable two 
entities in different countries to transfer money directly, eliminating 
the use of an intermediary bank. This can potentially save clients 
money, and will make the process simpler and faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though revenue from these
 technologies may not be big now, investment in these technologies is 
certainly theright approach, say experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As soon as the client 
base of global banking platform vendors (mainly banks) consider Bitcoin 
and Blockchain as mainstream, it will be the time when banking platform 
vendors should incorporate bitcoin/blockchain capabilities into their 
solutions," said Jost Hoppermann, vice-president, banking applications 
and architecture, at <span class="companylink">Forrester Research Inc</span>. "Vendors with more advanced architectures will certainly find it easier to offer this kind of support."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wipro</span> has set up the blockchain research facility at its Bengaluru campus to help its engineers build applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now whether it 
(blockchain) plays out in one year, two years or five years is a 
different thing. That is crystal-gazing," said Sanjiv, who reports into 
Rishad Premji, chief strategy officer and son of Wipro chairman Azim 
Premji.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>
 generates a tiny portion of its revenue from offering blockchain 
solutions but this could change, once more companies adopt this 
technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>
 report released on 12 August made a bold prediction that 80% of world's
 banks could start distributed ledger (shared digital data) projects by 
next year, thereby bringing blockchain technology at the heart of the 
global financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sanjiv declined to name the partners with whom the company is working on blockchain technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our objective is to gain
 expertise in all technologies as all of them are emerging because none 
of them is a winner for now," said Sanjiv.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TCS will launch a new offering as part of its core banking software, BaNCS later this year even as the company, like <span class="companylink">Infosys</span>, have got teams to build applications on blockchain technology for clients in healthcare and banking industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, 
Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. announced that it had
 entered into a partnership to develop blockchain solutions for secure 
record-keeping of documents for Japan's <span class="companylink">Mizuho Financial Group Inc</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MUMBAI: Indian IT 
companies declared a day-off in Bengaluru as the tensions escalated over
 the Supreme Court’s decision ordering Karnataka to release water from 
the Cauvery river to Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Infosys</span> and <span class="companylink">Tata Consultancy Services</span> have declared holidays, their spokespersons told ET.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“<span class="companylink">Wipro Limited</span>
 has declared a holiday for employees in Karnataka on Tuesday, September
 13. In lieu of this holiday, Saturday, September 17 will be a working 
day for offices of <span class="companylink">Wipro Limited</span> in the
 state. Business Continuity Plans have been invoked to avoid disruption 
to mission critical projects,” a Wipro spokesperson said in a email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cognizant has also 
declared a day-off and has invoked its business continuity plan, a 
company executive said. He declined to be identified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They have been stopping 
our buses and employees are feeling unsafe. We had to declare a holiday 
just for safety. These are calls being taken on a day-to-day basis,” an 
IT executive told ET. He declined to identified because of the 
sensitivity of the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cauvery river has 
been a cause of more than a century of trouble between the states. In 
1991, the city witnessed riots that killed over 15 people over a similar
 court order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest holiday comes 
after a city-wide bandh on Friday and comes at a terrible time for the 
industry. Bengaluru is the country’s major IT hub and work disruptions 
could affects billings and revenue at a time when the sector already 
faces weak growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The December floods in 
Chennai, which houses 15% of the industry’s IT workers, caused 
significant disruption to the sector and Bengaluru, often called the IT 
capital of the country, is a far larger base of IT talent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Monday court decision on water sharing near central India's tech hub spawned violence that is keeping workers at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riot police are trying to
 quell violence on the streets of Bengaluru, formerly Bangalore, in

 Reuters reports companies have closed their offices or asked people to

from Reuters:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The violence was 
triggered by a court decision Monday that asked the southern state of 
Karnataka to divert some water from the Cauvery river to neighboring 
Tamil Nadu state."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Narendra

From his statement:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The PM said that 
violence cannot provide solution to any problem and in a democracy, 
solutions are found through restraint and mutual dialogue. He urged 
people of the two states to display sensitivity and also keep in mind

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Delhi, Sept. 13 -- <span class="companylink">Infosys Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">Wipro Ltd</span>.
 closed offices in Bengaluru on Tuesday, after protests in Karnataka 
against the sharing of river water with neighbouring Tamil Nadu turned 
violent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The protests intensified 
on Monday after the country's Supreme Court court asked Karnataka to 
release 12,000 cubic feet per second of Cauvery river water everyday to 
Tamil Nadu until 20 September. Water sharing is a politically sensitive 
topic for Indian farmers, who predominantly depend on monsoon rains for 
crop cultivation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This dispute can only be
 solved within the legal ambit," Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a 
statement. "I am personally pained at the developments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A curfew was imposed in 
16 areas of Bengaluru city until 14 September after mobs vandalized 
vehicles and protested the court order, NDTV reported Tuesday, citing 
police. No new incidents have been reported, Bengaluru police said in a <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wipro</span> employees will work on 17

Wipro going slow on expanding headcount at Bhubaneswar</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT behemoth <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>'s expansion plan at its Bhubaneswar development centre is in the slow lane. <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>, which had committed to scale up its headcount in the city to 2,000 by April this year to catch up with larger peers like <span class="companylink">Infosys</span> and <span class="companylink">Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)</span>, is yet to deliver on its promised expansion plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources at the Odisha government said, <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>'s targeted addition in manpower is getting delayed. "<span class="companylink">Wipro</span>
 has informed that its first phase expansion in Bhubaneswar would be 
completed only by October. We are reviewing the status of their 
expansion", said an official source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At present, <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> has a pool of around 800 executives in Bhubaneswar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Wipro</span>
 remains committed to its investment and plans to grow in the city of 
Bhubaneswar. However, we do not disclose our facility-wise headcount and
 do not provide hiring projections", <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> said in an e-mail reply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> looked to expand headcount, it was planning to shift four important accounts including <span class="companylink">Electrolux</span> to the Bhubaneswar centre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December 2015, Wipro 
chairman Azim Premji in his maiden trip to Odisha had jointly taken 
stock of the company's Odisha project with top state officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wipro</span> had communicated to the state 
government last year regarding its ambitious plan to set up a 
28,000-seater facility in Bhubaneswar. The original plan was to 
construct five towers, which would house 11,000 technical associates. 
Although <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> commenced construction in 2007, it had gone slow on the work and lagged its peers <span class="companylink">Infosys</span>, <span class="companylink">Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) </span>and <span class="companylink">Tech Mahindra</span>, which have set up full-fledged campuses in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wipro</span> has been alloted 26 acres of land
 in 2005 in Infocity, one of the prime locations. The state government 
had even warned it would take back the land if <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>'s expansion project was delayed further.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With cyber-attacks 
becoming a primary concern for businesses in recent years, the need for

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheetal Mehta, Vice President &amp; Global Head, Cybersecurity &amp; Risk Services, <span class="companylink">Wipro Limited</span> said, “<span class="companylink">Wipro</span>'s
 ‘Threat Intelligence as a Service', aims to provide enterprises with 
targeted information centered around analytics, categorization and 
prioritization of cyber threats in real-time using proprietary data 
mining algorithms and unique machine learning techniques, apart from

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a media 
report, Intsights has developed a sophisticated cyber threat 
intelligence platform which provides advance warning and customized 
insights about potential cyberattacks and recommends remedial action. 
The company monitors the open, deep and dark web, including and social

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our partnership with <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>
 will allow their analysts to focus their efforts toward investigating

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>'s ‘Threat Hunting as- a- Service' offering, powered by <span class="companylink">Vectra Networks</span>, provides enterprises with an automated threat hunting platform for real-time detection of threats. <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>'s

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to <span class="companylink">Gartner</span>,
 most enterprises have limited capabilities to detect and respond to 
breaches when they inevitably occur, resulting in longer ‘dwell times'

because they do not have adequate solutions to detect breaches or cannot
 contain them in a reasonable period. <span class="companylink">Gartner</span>
 had also mentioned that by 2020, 60 per cent of enterprise information 
security budgets will be allocated to rapid detection and response 
approaches, up from less than 10 per cent in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As threats became more

become inadequate over time because they will continue to make snap

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2016 SEP 12 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- <span class="companylink">WIPRO LIMITED</span>
 (Bangalore, IN) has been issued patent number 9430534, according to 
news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by VerticalNews 
editors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The patent's inventors 
are Bhattacharya, Sourav S. (Fountain Hills, AZ); Bhattacharya, Anirban 
(Bangalore, IN); Shetty, Kuldip (Sastan, IN); Prasad Muraleedharan 
Pillai, Krishna (Kirkland, WA); Kumble, Ravi Udaya (Bangalore, IN); 
Aluri, Venu (Gudlavalleru, IN); Patel, Vitesh (Bangalore, IN).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This patent was filed on August 20, 2013 and was published online on August 30, 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the background 
information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the 
following quote: "Analytics is the discovery and communication of 
meaningful patterns in data. Firms may commonly apply analytics to 
business data to describe, predict, and improve business performance, 
and a person in an organization may execute analytics queries and obtain
 relevant data to facilitate decision making. For example, a requester 
in a department store may execute an analytics query related to 
profitability analysis of that facility. The confidentiality of 
analytics queries can avoid leakage of trade secrets and sensitive 
information related to business decisions. For example, in the scenario 
above, access to the analytics query may allow internal developers and 
third parties to predict that the organization may be considering the 
closing of a store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Further, analytics 
queries may include two types of data: certain data and uncertain data. A
 query causes a company data system to retrieve outputs, and display 
them to the requester. In most queries, some data will be certain, such 
as total sales for the previous calendar year, and other data will be 
uncertain, such as total sales for the next calendar year. Typically, 
analytics queries do not take into account or process the uncertain 
data. Further, there is ambiguity in the interpretation of analytics 
outputs. For example, an analytics query for 'electronic chip P123', may
 reasonably be interpreted as concerning: i) which devices use the P123 
electronic chip or ii) future sales predictions of the P123 electronic 
chip. Thus, the output of such a query may be ambiguous. Also, the 
analytics outputs associated with different business scenarios are not 
generally considered or provided."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supplementing the 
background information on this patent, VerticalNews reporters also 
obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: "In one 
embodiment, an analytics system is disclosed, comprising: a processor; 
and a memory device operatively connected to the processor and storing 
processor-executable instructions for: receiving an application 
programming interface (API) call for a service; parsing the API call to 
extract an API call name and one or more API call parameters; generating
 prediction values for one or more interpreted-data parameters; 
obtaining one or more analytics rules; performing an analytics operation
 to generate an analytics result according to the one or more analytics 
rules based on at least the generated prediction values for the one or 
more interpreted-data parameters and the extracted one or more API call 
parameters; and generating a visual representation of the analytics 
result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is to be understood 
that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed 
description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive 
of the invention, as claimed."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Delhi, Sep 12 (IANS) 
When award-winning architect Vidur Bharadwaj took to art, it was natural
 for him to infuse the canvas with expressions of nature and imageries 
of historic monuments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brain behind 'green buildings' like -- <span class="companylink">Wipro Technologies</span>, Gurgaon, Patni Campus and The Four Seasons Hotel, Noida -- believes that it's his responsibility to adopt sustainable art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In today's era of glass 
buildings, we are losing the basic essence that made earlier buildings 
sustainable. It has always been my conscious effort to make my projects 
socially, economically and environmentally sustainable," said Bharadwaj.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His first solo show titled 'Soul In Structure', is scheduled to be opened at India Habitat Centre here on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this show, Chairman of <span class="companylink">Indian Green Building Council</span>
 (IGBC), Delhi Chapter, Bharadwaj will be exhibiting 15 canvases in 
mixed media combining architecture and design elements of historical 
monuments and cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While courtyards, 
terraces, verandas along with water bodies, wind and sunlight suffuse 
his palette, imagery of sun and a child are omnipresent in most works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sun is the source of all energy and child represents the future, for whom we have to save this planet," says the artist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have combined 
photographs of my projects with the elements that inspire me as an 
architect, be it nature, monuments or moments," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inspired by 'haveli' construction with courtyards and windows, one of the paintings titled '<span class="companylink">Wipro</span>, Gurgaon' has used elements to design the sustainable building of Wipro Technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The courtyard in the 
painting has bigger windows on the bottom to hardness natural light and 
smaller deep windows on the upper levels for controlled daylight," said 
the artist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept of nature 
walk has been highlighted in the installation titled 'Green Boulevard', 
which drew inspiration from Mughal architecture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The painting titled 'Tech Boulevard' also highlights the grid system and proportions used in planning Fatehpur Sikri.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another painting 
'Home', the artist uses details from his own residence. "It was my dream
 to create an eco-system attracting beautiful creatures like birds and 
fish. I believe that a house is a living being and it should be able to 
live, breath and sustain itself," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another artwork 'Shunya' highlights the zero energy concept and the painting is circular representing zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Brown, blue and green in
 concentric circles represent various elements that contribute to 
building development like site, energy, water and materials leading to a
 'zero'," said Bharadwaj.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exhibition will open at Visual Arts Gallery, India Habitat Centre from September 16-22.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enables real-time attack visibility to prevent cyber attacks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business Editors, Technology Editors</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BANGALORE, India &amp; LONDON--(Business Wire)--September 12, 2016</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wipro Limited</span> (NYSE: WIT, <span class="companylink">BSE</span>: 507685, NSE: <span class="companylink">WIPRO</span>),
 a leading global information technology, consulting, and business 
process services company, today announced a partnership with <span class="companylink">Vectra Networks</span>,
 a Silicon Valley-based cybersecurity company that provides automated 
threat management solutions for real-time detection of in-progress cyber
 attacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wipro</span> will leverage the Vectra 
automated threat management platform built with artificial 
intelligence-based on machine learning and behavioral analytics to 
detect attacker behaviors and user anomalies in the network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to <span class="companylink">Gartner</span>,
 “Most enterprises have limited capabilities to detect and respond to 
breaches when they inevitably occur, resulting in longer ‘dwell times’ 
and increased damage.”1</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We believe organizations 
these days incur significant fines because they do not have adequate 
solutions to detect breaches or cannot contain them in a reasonable 
period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Gartner</span> also says that by 2020, 60% of 
enterprise information security budgets will be allocated to rapid 
detection and response approaches — up from less than 10% in 2014.1</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As threats became more 
intelligent and sophisticated, traditional security solutions will 
become inadequate over time because they will continue to make snap 
judgments based on incomplete information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wipro</span>’s ‘Threat Hunting as- a- Service’ offering, powered by <span class="companylink">Vectra Networks</span>, provides enterprises with an automated threat hunting platform for real-time detection of threats. <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>’s
 offering complements the Vectra platform with comprehensive ‘Threat 
Life Cycle Management Capabilities and Services’ to the enterprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wipro</span> offers its ‘Threat Hunting as- a-
 Service’ round-the-clock from its Cyber Defense Centers spread across 
the world, including Georgia and Texas, USA, Mississauga, Canada, 
Warsaw, Poland and multiple centers in India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are very excited to 
partner with Vectra to launch our ‘Threat Hunting as- a -Service 
offering,’" said Hiral Chandrana, Senior Vice President &amp; Global 
Head, Business Applications and Cybersecurity &amp; Risk Services, <span class="companylink">Wipro Limited</span>. “‘Threat Hunting as- a- Service’ combines the best of next-gen technology from <span class="companylink">Vectra Networks</span> and managed services from <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>. This service, which is part of <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>’s Cyber Defense Platform, is key to our strategy to meet the cyber threat management demands of enterprises, worldwide.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Many organizations already leverage <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>’s
 managed security services as a natural extension of their IT 
organization,” said Hitesh Sheth, Chief Executive Officer of Vectra 
Networks. “Our partnership with <span class="companylink">Wipro</span> 
will fast-track our global footprint and significantly increase our 
ability to address the security and service needs of large enterprises. 
Using the Vectra automated threat management platform, <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wipro Limited</span> (NYSE: WIT, <span class="companylink">BSE</span>: 507685, NSE: <span class="companylink">WIPRO</span>),
 a leading global information technology, consulting, and business 
process services company, today announced a partnership with <span class="companylink">Vectra Networks</span>,
 a Silicon Valley-based cybersecurity company that provides automated 
threat management solutions for real-time detection of in-progress cyber
 attacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wipro</span> will leverage the Vectra 
automated threat management platform built with artificial 
intelligence-based on machine learning and behavioral analytics to 
detect attacker behaviors and user anomalies in the network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to <span class="companylink">Gartner</span>,
 "Most enterprises have limited capabilities to detect and respond to 
breaches when they inevitably occur, resulting in longer 'dwell times' 
and increased damage."(1)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We believe organizations 
these days incur significant fines because they do not have adequate 
solutions to detect breaches or cannot contain them in a reasonable 
period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Gartner</span> also says that by 2020, 60% of 
enterprise information security budgets will be allocated to rapid 
detection and response approaches -- up from less than 10% in 2014.(1)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As threats became more 
intelligent and sophisticated, traditional security solutions will 
become inadequate over time because they will continue to make snap 
judgments based on incomplete information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wipro</span>'s 'Threat Hunting as- a- Service' offering, powered by <span class="companylink">Vectra Networks</span>, provides enterprises with an automated threat hunting platform for real-time detection of threats. <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>'s

 Lenovo set to attend retreat for strategic discussion in Goa on 
September 16, 17. VIKANT SAHAY explores the potential implications for 
Goa as an IT destination</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sequence has not 
broken and a series of visits by IT companies seems to be a continual 
process. At least, 20 senior-level management of different Information 
Technology and related companies, which includes companies like <span class="companylink">Intel</span>, <span class="companylink">IBM</span>, <span class="companylink">Wipro</span>, Lenovo etc will be here in Goa for business with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacture Association of Information Technology (<span class="companylink">MAIT</span>),
 a lead body for IT hardware in India is organising a retreat for 
startegic discussion and executive council meeting at Goa on September 
16-17 in which managing director, South Asia of <span class="companylink">Intel</span> and President of MAIT, Debjani Ghosh will be present along with other leading senior management of different companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chief Minister of 
Goa, Laxmikant Parsekar along with the Director Information and 
Technology, Ameya Abhyankar will in all likelihood, have a roundtable 
discussion with these company representatives and explore possibilities 
for tie-up with them for helping Goa on e-governance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Probably this will be for
 the first time that Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Events 
(MICE) tourism will actually be facilitating for business by <span class="companylink">MAIT</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nitin Kunkoleinker, All 
India Senior Vice President of MAIT who also is member of Goas 
Investment Promotion Board is piloting the entire event in Goa. When 
asked why this event was held in Goa, Mr Kunkoleinker said, We have had 
our retreat in Delhi, Bangaluru, Raipur etc. This time we said why not 
Goa as the State will be beautiful after the monsoons. IT and beauty 
should go together. Also, Goa is now showing keen interest in IT so it 
was an ideal time for us to make both ends meet which will be mutually 
beneficial and ultimately benefit Goa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Goa government has 
been briefed about this retreat to which, the government has responded 
very positively and CM has kept an interactive session with this <span class="companylink">MAIT</span>
 group on September 16 as he wants to interact with them and listen to 
what and how they can come forward to help Goa in its IT endeavour, 
added Mr Kunkoleinker. It could be an excellent opportunity for the IT 
companies to express their willingness to partner with the State.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the concern is 
that Goa has not been highlighted as a manufacturing destination yet. 
Thoughts among engineering, electronic and IT manufacturing units in 
India are emerging now that Goa can be used as a manufacturing hub and 
have centers like R&amp;D, as the logistics in Goa are more or less in 
place. Goa is well connected through air, port and road. But little more
 time is needed for Goa to integrate these already available logistics. 
Also, the travel time within Goa is not more than an hour in any case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talking to Herald the 
Chairman of Logistics Committee of Goa Chambers of Commerce and Industry
 (GCCI), Chandrakant Gawas said, We would welcome such steps by the 
industry but Goa must educate those companies about the true facts. This
 may help the industry to play a longer innings here in the State and 
safeguard the jobs of the skilled manpower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Gawas added that 
recently a delegation of GCCI has visited China and they got an 
excellent response. Many companies in China are eyeing Goa as their 
business destination, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goa can actually look at 
this opportunity to develop their capacity in sectors like design, 
social sector, e-governance and technology under three perspectives. (a)
 All these companies are global players and building up synergy with 
these players; (b) Goa is a place which is already famous in different 
corners of the world and sending a message across the industry that Goa 
is a serious partner in business too and (c) Lot of initiatives in 
corporate social responsibility with business can be clubbed in Goa like
 launch of pilot projects in smart education, smart city, street 
lighting etc.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bloomberg</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Tata Consultancy Services Ltd</span>. sent a 
gauge of technology companies to the lowest level in almost two years 
after a report that Asia’s most valuable software exporter is witnessing
 a slowdown in its key financial-services arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company’s shares 
tumbled the most since October 2014 after CNBC TV18 reported that some 
of its U.S. customers are pulling back discretionary spending. 
Application development made up 40 percent of sales for Tata Consultancy
 in 2016. Tata, <span class="companylink">Infosys Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">Wipro Ltd</span>. were the worst performers on the benchmark S&amp;P <span class="companylink">BSE</span> Sensex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowing industry growth, a
 transition into digital services and the economic uncertainty around 
Britain’s decision to depart the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> have taken the sheen off Indian IT services firms. <span class="companylink">Mindtree Ltd</span>. Tuesday pared its revenue guidance for the current quarter, citing project cancellations. In July, <span class="companylink">Infosys</span> slashed its annual sales forecast, sending its shares down by the most in a single day since April 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Guidance downgrades from
 software managements will continue to play spoilsport as long as 
earnings visibility remains low,” Kaushik Dani, a Mumbai-based fund 
manager at <span class="companylink">Karvy Stock Broking Ltd</span>., said by phone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">BSE</span>
 IT Index has retreated 8.6 percent this year, while the Sensex has 
rallied 11 percent to near its March 2015 all-time high. The software 
gauge hasn’t posted an annual loss since 2011, when it slumped 18 
percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indian stocks extended 
the longest run of monthly gains in two years as investors looking for 
higher returns than those in developed countries add to their purchases 
of local shares. Foreigners bought $210 million of local equities this 
week, taking the year’s inflow to $6.3 billion, the most in Asia after 
Taiwan and South Korea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rally has left the 
Sensex trading at 16.7 times projected 12-month earnings, the most 
expensive since January 2011 and higher than the five-year mean of 14.4,
 according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The MSCI Emerging Markets 
Index trades at a multiple of 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Valuations have become steep after the liquidity-driven rally,” said Dani. “Stocks need to stabilize at current levels.”</p>
